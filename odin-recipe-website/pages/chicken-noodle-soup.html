        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>8 cups chicken stock</li>

        <li>2 1/2 pounds bone-in, skinless chicken breasts</li>
        <li>2 1/2 cups wide egg noodles</li>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Melt butter in a large stockpot or Dutch oven over 
            medium heat. Add onion, carrots and celery. Cook, 
            stirring occasionally, until tender, about 3-4 minutes. 
            Stir in garlic until fragrant, about 1 minute.
        </li>
        <li>
            Whisk in chicken stock and bay leaves; season with salt 
            and pepper, to taste. Add chicken and bring to boil; reduce 
            heat and simmer, covered, until the chicken is cooked through, 
            about 30-40 minutes. Remove chicken and let cool before dicing 
            into bite-size pieces, discarding bones.
        </li>
        <li>
            Stir in chicken and pasta and cook until tender, about 6-7 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Remove from heat; stir in parsley, dill and lemon juice; season 
            with salt and pepper, to taste.
        </li>
